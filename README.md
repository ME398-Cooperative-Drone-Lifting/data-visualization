# Data Visualization

Some sample code to visualize the drone's locations.

sample_data.py: .csv file updater and random data generation. Creates sampledata.csv and updates it randomly as if it was being populated by the drone.
test_plot.py: live plotter to trace follower drone location and altitude.
